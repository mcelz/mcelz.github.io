                PlayerUnknown's BattleGrounds is an online multiplayer battle
                royale game, developed and published by PUBG Corporation. In
                the game, up to 100 players parachute onto an island and search
                for weapons and equipment to kill others, while avoiding to get
                killed. The safe zone in the map shortens 
                every few minutes, forcing players to move to a more central area.
                The last player left standing wins the game.

            PUBG was originally designed as a Personal Computer game. But as of today, 
            it developed to incorporate both console and mobile gaming. Its development was 
            everything but smooth. It was originally scheduled to launch by early 2017, but 
            only launched at the end of the year. The game was lacking testing, and was full
            of bugs, which will come back and hurt the company later.

          <p>
            After its initial launch, PUBG went instantly viral in the gaming community. It 
            revolutionized the classic first-person shooting perspective that all shooting 
            games were adopting at the moment. Every named streamer at 
            <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/" target="_blank">twitch</a> 
            would be playing PUBG, which fueled the spread of the game even further. After its initial launch, 
            it reached its astonishing peak of 3 million concurrent players online. However, the 
            constant presence of bugs, and lack of testing led to its eventual downfall. Later, 
            the company decided to switch strategy and invest their efforts in the mobile 
            gaming industry. surprinsingly, their efforts paid out, and they are now the 
            top-grossing battle royale shooting game in mobile gaming.

            The game went through a long testing phase in China, which eventually paid off. The game 
            had to change its name to 'Game for Peace' and many "violent" features had to be adapted. However,
            these efforts were not wasted, as China represents PUBG's  #1 playerbase. 

            <br />
            
            PUBG also faced some relegations in India, where the game was banned for its violence. 
            PUBG is still working on adjusting game features to accomodate the Indian gaming community.

            <h3>PUBG Net Worth</h3>
          </header>
          <p>
            According to 
            <a href="https://www.wealthypersons.com/pubg-net-worth-2020-2021/" target="_blank">wealthypersons.com</a> 
            PUBG has reached a net worth of $5 billion in 2020. The mobile version alone
            garnered over $1.5 Billion by 2019, and the game does not seem to decrease 
            in revenue by anytime soon. With this amount of money, it is hard to be put into 
            prospective. Hence, we chose to compare it with Michael Jordan's shoes company
            (Air Jordan), which according to 
            <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-michael-jordan-spends-his-money-2015-3" target="_blank">sources</a>
            , has a net worth of $1.6 billion, which totally pales in comparison.

            PUBG Mobile is universally played by both genders. The female to male gender ratio is about 4:6, 
            which suggests growth space for more active female audience. Already PUBG has tried to attract
            female audience by offering a wide range of aestehtically pleasing clothing to purchase within the game
             and had collaborated with popular idols to promote more advertising for PUBG.

              This is the map of the island that each player is going to jump into. 
              Each player will have to loot for weapons and medicines, all before the playable 
              map starts to shorten, and players are forced to move to a more crowded area. 
              As a result, it is essential to understand which locations have more resources, 
              so you can use these resources to survive and kill the rest of the participants. 
              You also have to be careful avoiding places with too many resources, as they will 
              be filled with other people, which will kill you before you can even explore the 
              island.

            <p>
              PUBG has a great variety of guns for players to choose, from pistols and SMGs, to assault rifles and sniper rifles. 
              These weapons vary in their availability, shooting range, and damage per bullet.
              It could be very confusing for beginners to think about which two guns they should equip.
              To make it simpler for beginners, here are top ten guns players often used to kill
              and the average shooting distance of these 10 guns according to data from an incredibly detailed gaming website <a href=" ">Gosu</a >.

              Choosing where to parachute onto is also a very strategic move. 
              Resources such as vests, helmets, backpacks, throwables, and weapons 
              are by no means evenly distributed across the map. Some places have high resources,
              where many players would choose, yet too many players means there bound to be savage battles on landing.
              Places that have less resources could be safe at first, but the safe zone would gradually reduce to the central area, 
              without transportation vehicles, players might not have the time to flee the dead zone. 
              On the left is a vivid illustration of these difficult choices.
